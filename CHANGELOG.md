## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Nav rework — 5-tab bottom nav**: Today / Log & Ask / Charts / Learn / Settings. Removed dedicated Body and History tabs; Settings is now a first-class nav item.
- **History tab inside Charts (Analytics)**: History week view is now accessible as a third tab inside the Analytics screen alongside Nutrition and Body. The `/history` route still works as a standalone page.
- **Body measurement nudge on Dashboard**: amber dismissable banner appears when the last logged body measurement is more than 14 days ago (or never). Links to `/measurements`. Dismissed state persists for the session (sessionStorage).
- **Suggestion chips in Chat**: when the chat is fresh (first open or after clearing history), a horizontal scrollable row of 4 tappable chips appears above the input bar — *"2 eggs and toast 🍳"*, *"How am I doing today? 📊"*, *"Is my protein high enough?"*, *"Summarise this week"*. Tapping a chip prefills the text input without auto-sending.
- **API key explainer modal redesign**: replaced numbered text steps with a JSX mockup of the Google AI Studio UI (browser chrome + API keys page + copy action) plus a quota info card showing the free-tier limit (1,500 req/day) with a link to view usage in AI Studio.
- **Onboarding Done screen polish** (step 6): full-width layout with side-by-side hero icon+title, daily target card with macro split pill bar, 3-column macro grid cards, and an encouragement note.
- **Onboarding default activity**: default activity multiplier changed from Moderate (1.55) to Lightly active (1.375) — closer to the average sedentary/office worker.
- **`navSettings` i18n key** added to all 7 languages; `navLog` updated across all languages to convey "Log & Ask"; `chatWelcome` updated to highlight both meal logging and Q&A in one sentence; 4 `chatSuggestion*` chip strings added; `bodyNudgeText`/`bodyNudgeAction`/`apiKeyQuotaNote`/`apiKeyViewUsage` added.

### Changed
- Settings page now shows the bottom nav bar (was hidden before — now it's a main nav tab).
- `HIDE_NAV_ROUTES` reduced to `['/onboarding']` only.

- **Google Analytics 4** (G-CX3LDP2Y41): page-view tracking on every HashRouter navigation plus custom events — `meal_saved`, `meal_discarded`, `meal_edited`, `meal_log_started` (method: text/photo/voice), `nutrition_question_asked`, `chat_history_cleared`, `api_key_saved`, `goals_updated`, `language_changed`, `data_exported`, `onboarding_completed`, `measurement_logged`, `article_opened`. IP anonymization enabled; no PII sent.
- **Microsoft Clarity** (project `vr5878quce`): free heatmap and session-recording tool injected via standard snippet in `index.html`.
- **`src/lib/analytics.ts`**: typed analytics helper — all `gtag()` calls centralised here; no-ops gracefully if gtag is blocked.
- **Persistent logo strip**: a fixed `<header>` at the top of the app shell shows the Diet Tracker icon and wordmark on every screen (opacity-muted, non-interactive, `z-50`).
- **First-time onboarding flow** (`/onboarding`): 6-step wizard — Welcome (with language picker), Nutrition Primer (protein/fat/carbs explained with macro split visual + link to articles), Body Stats (sex/age/weight/height, metric with conversion hints), Activity & Goal, Results with connected macro sliders, and Done screen. Calculates personalised calorie and macro targets using Mifflin-St Jeor BMR × activity TDEE.
- **Macro distribution insights**: live contextual note on the onboarding slider screen explains how the current protein/fat/carbs split will affect lifestyle — warns about muscle loss for low protein (<1.2g/kg), hormone issues for very low fat (<20%), keto territory for high fat (>40%) or low carbs (<80g), and shows positive feedback for balanced distributions.
- **Connected macro sliders**: protein and fat sliders update carbs automatically within calorie budget; slider bounds enforce healthy minimums (≥20% of calories from fat, ≥20g carbs). Protein defaults to 1.8–2.0g/kg depending on goal.
- **Onboarding weight → Body log**: the `weightKg` entered during onboarding is saved as the first `BodyMeasurement` record, so the Body log is pre-populated immediately after setup.
- `src/lib/goalCalculator.ts` — pure calculation functions for BMR, TDEE, calorie target, macro goals, and slider bounds. 26 Vitest tests added.
- `OnboardingProfile` type in `src/types/index.ts`; `UserSettings` extended with `onboardingComplete` and `onboardingProfile`.
- Existing users auto-migrated to skip onboarding via `migrateSettings()` called in `main.tsx`.
- **PWA maskable icon**: `public/icons/icon-maskable-512x512.png` — icon at 75% scale on 512×512 dark background, keeping content within the W3C safe zone. Manifest uses this dedicated file for `purpose: maskable`.
- **Chat history persistence**: messages saved to `localStorage` (`dtk_chat_history`), restored on re-open. Max 100 messages; `setup` messages excluded. Trash icon in header clears history with confirmation.
- **LLM-powered nutrition Q&A**: free-form questions in chat ("how am I doing today?", "is my protein high enough?") are automatically classified and routed to `askNutritionQuestion`. Context includes today's goals and consumed macros, last 7 days of daily totals, and latest logged body weight.
- `classifyIntent(userInput, lang)` — lightweight Gemini call (64 token output) returning `'log' | 'question'`.
- `askNutritionQuestion(question, lang, context)` — plain-text coaching response via Gemini.
- `NutritionContext` interface with `recentDays` and `latestWeight` fields.
- New `'answer'` chat role — distinct bubble style with `whitespace-pre-wrap`.
- **"Uff, what is an API key?" explainer modal**: a help icon + link next to the API key field in Settings and in the Chat setup card opens a friendly bottom-sheet explaining what an API key is, 3 numbered steps, and a direct link to Google AI Studio. Available in all 7 languages.
- **Edit and delete meal actions**: pencil + trash icons on hover (desktop) and after 300ms long-press (mobile). Available on Dashboard meal cards and History rows.
- **Edit Meal dialog**: inline description/notes editing that saves to IndexedDB without re-parsing.
- **Articles fully internationalised**: all 4 articles are now available in all 7 app languages (en, ru, uk, cs, de, fr, es). Titles, excerpts, tags, and full content are translated. Language switches instantly without page reload.
- **New article** "Sport & Active Lifestyle: What Exercise Actually Does" — covers why exercise doesn't replace diet but matters for hormonal balance, muscle mass (permanent BMR boost), sleep, and mental health; 7–10k daily steps; bodyweight training for beginners.
- Two new article section types: `stat-row` (3-column key-figure grid with amber values) and `visual-bar` (horizontal bar comparison chart with colour-coded bars). Reworked all 3 existing articles to be shorter and more direct.
- Articles section (`/articles`) with evidence-based nutrition guides.
- SEO meta tags, JSON-LD structured data, `robots.txt`, `sitemap.xml`.
- Accessibility improvements on MacroRing, MacroBar, MealCard, BottomNav, FAB.

### Changed
- **"Clear all data" → archive instead of delete**: settings and chat history are renamed to `dtk_archive_<timestamp>_*` keys (recoverable) instead of permanently deleted. IndexedDB is cleared and the user is returned to onboarding.
- Chat page header shows "Nutrition Assistant" and placeholder updated to "Log a meal or ask a question...".
- Migrated from `gemini-2.0-flash` (retired 2026-03-03) to `gemini-2.5-flash`.
- `maxOutputTokens` raised to 4096 to prevent truncated JSON from thinking model.
- Back button added to Settings screen.
- Animation polish across all pages and components.

### Fixed
- FAB on Dashboard no longer overflows outside the centered `max-w-md` column on desktop.
- BottomNav shown on Chat page; content adjusted with `pb-20`.
